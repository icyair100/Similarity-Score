was slipping through his brain without leaving the slightest trace of meaning behind. He was waiting for 
a call from the President of a far distant country, and between wondering when the wretched man would 
telephone, and trying to suppress unpleasant memories of what had been a very long, tiring, and difficult 
week, there was not much space in his head for anything else. The more he attempted to focus on the 
print on the page before him, the more clearly the Prime Minister could see the gloating face of one of his 
political opponents. This particular opponent had appeared on the news that very day, not only to 
enumerate all the terrible things that had happened in the last week (as though anyone needed reminding) 
but also to explain why each and every one of them was the government's fault.


The Prime Minister's pulse quickened at the very thought of these accusations, for they were neither fair nor 
true. How on earth was his government supposed to have stopped that bridge collapsing? It was outrageous for 
anybody to suggest that they were not spending enough on bridges. The bridge was fewer than ten years old, 
and the best experts were at a loss to explain why it had snapped cleanly in two, sending a dozen cars into the 
watery depths of the river below. And how dare anyone suggest that it was lack of policemen that had resulted 
in those two very nasty and well-publicized murders? Or that the government should have somehow foreseen 
the freak hurricane in the West Country that had caused so much damage to both people and property? And was 
it his fault that one of his Junior Ministers, Herbert Chorley, had chosen this week to act so peculiarly that he 
was now going to be spending a lot more time with his family?

"A grim mood has gripped the country," the opponent had concluded, barely concealing his own 
broad grin.

And unfortunately, this was perfectly true. The Prime Minister felt it himself; people really did seem 
more miserable than usual. Even the weather was dismal; all this chilly mist in the middle of July... It 
wasn't right, it wasn't normal...

He turned over the second page of the memo, saw how much longer it went on, and gave it up as a bad job. 
Stretching his arms above his head he looked around his office mournfully. It was a handsome room, with 
a fine marble fireplace facing the long sash windows, firmly closed against the unseasonable chill. With a 
slight shiver, the Prime Minister got up and moved over to the window, looking out at the thin mist that 
was pressing itself against the glass. It was then, as he stood with his back to the room, that he heard a soft 
cough behind him.

He froze, nose to nose with his own scared-looking reflection in the dark glass. He knew that cough. 
He had heard it before. He turned very slowly to face the empty room. : ¦

"Hello?" he said, trying to sound braver than he felt.

For a brief moment he allowed himself the impossible hope that nobody would answer him. However, a voice 
responded at once, a crisp, decisive voice that sounded as though it were reading a prepared statement. It was 
coming -- as the Prime Minister had known at the first cough -- from the froglike little man wearing a long 
silver wig who was depicted in a small, dirty oil painting in the far corner of the room.

"To the Prime Minister of Muggles. Urgent we meet. Kindly respond immediately. Sincerely, Fudge."

The man in the painting looked inquiringly at the Prime Minister.

"Er," said the Prime Minister, "listen... Its not a very good time for me... I'm waiting for a telephone call,






you see... from the President of--"

"That can be rearranged," said the portrait at once. The Prime Minister's heart sank. He had been afraid 
of that.

"But I really was rather hoping to speak--"

"We shall arrange for the President to forget to call. He will telephone tomorrow night instead," said 
the little man. "Kindly respond immediately to Mr. Fudge."

"I... oh ... very well," said the Prime Minister weakly. "Yes, I'll see Fudge."

He hurried back to his desk, straightening his tie as he went. He had barely resumed his seat, and arranged 
his face into what he hoped was a relaxed and unfazed expression, when bright green flames burst into 
life in the empty grate beneath his marble mantelpiece. He watched, trying not to betray a flicker of 
surprise or alarm, as a portly man appeared within the flames, spinning as fast as a top. Seconds later, he 
had climbed out onto a rather fine antique rug, brushing ash from the sleeves of his long pin-striped cloak, 
a lime-green bowler hat in his hand.

"Ah ... Prime Minister," said Cornelius Fudge, striding forward with his hand outstretched. "Good to 
see you again."

The Prime Minister could not honestly return this compliment, so said nothing at all. He was not remotely 
pleased to see Fudge, whose occasional appearances, apart from being downright alarming in themselves, 
generally meant that he was about to hear some very bad news. Furthermore, Fudge was looking 
distinctly careworn. He was thinner, balder, and grayer, and his face had a crumpled look. The Prime 
Minister had seen that kind of look in politicians before, and it never boded well.

"How can I help you?" he said, shaking Fudge's hand very briefly and gesturing toward the hardest of 
the chairs in front of the desk.

"Difficult to know where to begin," muttered Fudge, pulling up the chair, sitting down, and placing 
his green bowler upon his knees. "What a week, what a week..."

"Had a bad one too, have you?" asked the Prime Minister stiffly, hoping to convey by this that he had 
quite enough on his plate already without any extra helpings from Fudge.

"Yes, of course," said Fudge, rubbing his eyes wearily and looking morosely at the Prime Minister. 
"I've been having the same week you have, Prime Minister. The Brockdale Bridge... the Bones and 
Vance murders... not to mention the ruckus in the West Country..."

"You--er--your--I mean to say, some of your people were--were involved in those--those things, 
were they?"

Fudge fixed the Prime Minister with a rather stern look. "Of course they were," he said, "Surely 
you've realized what's going on?"

"I..." hesitated the Prime Minister.

It was precisely this sort of behavior that made him dislike Fudge's visits so much. He was, after all, the 
Prime Minister and did not appreciate being made to feel like an ignorant schoolboy. But of course, it 
had been like this from his very first meeting with Fudge on his very first evening as Prime Minister. He






remembered it as though it were yesterday and knew it would haunt him until his dying day.

He had been standing alone in this very office, savoring the triumph that was his after so many years of 
dreaming and scheming, when he had heard a cough behind him, just like tonight, and turned to find that 
ugly little portrait talking to him, announcing that the Minister of Magic was about to arrive and 
introduce himself

Naturally, he had thought that the long campaign and the strain of the election had caused him to go mad. 
He had been utterly terrified to find a portrait talking to him, though this had been nothing to how he felt 
when a self-proclaimed wizard had bounced out of the fireplace and shaken his hand. He had remained 
speechless throughout Fudge's kindly explanation that there were witches and wizards still living in secret 
all over the world and his reassurances that he was not to bother his head about them as the Ministry of 
Magic took responsibility for the whole Wizarding community and prevented the non-magical population 
from getting wind of them. It was, said Fudge, a difficult job that encompassed everything from 
regulations on responsible use of broomsticks to keeping the dragon population under control (the Prime 
Minister remembered clutching the desk for support at this point). Fudge had then patted the shoulder of 
the sLill-dumbstruck Prime Minister in a fatherly sort of way.

"Not to worry," he had said, "it's odds-on you'll never see me again. I'll only bother you if there's 
something really serious going on our end, something that's likely to affect the Muggles--the non-magical 
population, I should say. Otherwise, it's live and let live. And I must say, you're taking it a lot better than 
your predecessor. He tried to throw me out the window, thought I was a hoax planned by the opposition."

At this, the Prime Minister had found his voice at last. "You're--you're not a hoax, then?"

It had been his last, desperate hope.

"No," said Fudge gently. "No, I'm afraid I'm not. Look."

And he had turned the Prime Minister's teacup into a gerbil.

"But," said the Prime Minister breathlessly, watching his teacup chewing on the corner of his next 
speech, "but why--why has nobody told me--?"

"The Minister of Magic only reveals him--or herself to the Muggle Prime Minister of the day," said 
Fudge, poking his wand back inside his jacket. "We find it the best way to maintain secrecy."

"But then," bleated the Prime Minister, "why hasn't a former Prime Minister warned me--?"

At this, Fudge had actually laughed.

"My dear Prime Minister, are you ever going to tell anybody?"

Still chortling, Fudge had thrown some powder into the fireplace, stepped into the emerald flames, and 
vanished with a whooshing sound. The Prime Minister had stood there, quite motionless, and realized that 
he would never, as long as he lived, dare mention this encounter to a living soul, for who in the wide 
world would believe him?

The shock had taken a little while to wear off. For a time, he had tried to convince himself that Fudge had 
indeed been a hallucination brought on by lack of sleep during his grueling election campaign. In a vain 
attempt to rid himself of all reminders of this uncomfortable encounter, he had given the gerbil to his 
delighted niece and instructed his private secretary to take down the portrait of the ugly little man who had






announced Fudge's arrival. To the Prime Minister's dismay, however, the portrait had proved impossible to 
remove. When several carpenters, a builder or two, an art historian, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer 
had all tried unsuccessfully to prise it from the wall, the Prime Minister had abandoned the attempt and 
simply resolved to hope that the thing remained motionless and silent for the rest of his term in office. 
Occasionally he could have sworn he saw out of the corner of his eye the occupant of the painting 
yawning, or else scratching his nose; even, once or twice, simply walking out of his frame and leaving 
nothing but a stretch of muddy-brown canvas behind. However, he had trained himself not to look at the 
picture very much, and always to tell himself firmly that his eyes were playing tricks on him when 
anything like this happened.

Then, three years ago, on a night very like tonight, the Prime Minister had been alone in his office when 
the portrait had once again announced the imminent arrival of Fudge, who had burst out of the fireplace, 
sopping wet and in a state of considerable panic. Before the Prime Minister could ask why he was dripping 
all over the Axminster, Fudge had started ranting about a prison the Prime Minister had never heard of, a 
man named "Serious" Black, something that sounded like "Hogwarts," and a boy called Harry Potter, none 
of which made the remotest sense to the Prime Minister.

"...I've just come from Azkaban," Fudge had panted, tipping a large amount of water out of the rim of his 
bowler hat into his pocket. "Middle of the North Sea, you know, nasty flight... the dementors are in uproar"--
he shuddered--"they've never had a breakout before. Anyway, I had to come to you, Prime Minister. Black's a 
known Muggle killer and may be planning to rejoin You-Know-Who.... But of course,

you don't even know who You-Know-Who is!" He had gazed hopelessly at the Prime Minister for 
a moment, then said, "Well, sit down, sit down, I'd better fill you in... Have a whiskey..."

The Prime Minister rather resented being told to sit down in his own office, let alone offered his own 
whiskey, but he sat nevertheless. Fudge pulled out his wand, conjured two large glasses full of amber 
liquid out of thin air, pushed one of them into the Prime Minister's hand, and drew up a chair.

Fudge had talked for more than an hour. At one point, he had refused to say a certain name aloud and 
wrote it instead on a piece of parchment, which he had thrust into the Prime Minister's whiskey-free hand. 
When at last Fudge had stood up to leave, the Prime Minister had stood up too.

"So you think that..." He had squinted down at the name in his left hand. "Lord Vol--"

"He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!" snarled Fudge.

"I'm sorry... You think that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is still alive, then?"

"Well, Dumbledore says he is," said Fudge, as he had fastened his pin-striped cloak under his chin, "but 
we've never found him. If you ask me, he's not dangerous unless he's got support, so it's Black we ought to 
be worrying about. You'll put out that warning, then? Excellent. Well, I hope we don't see each other 
again, Prime Minister! Good night."

But they had seen each other again. Less than a year later a harassed-looking Fudge had appeared out of 
thin air in the cabinet room to inform the Prime Minister that there had been a spot of bother at the 
Kwidditch (or that was what it had sounded like) World Cup and that several Muggles had been 
"involved," but that the Prime Minister was not to worry, the fact that You-Know-Who's Mark had been 
seen again meant nothing; Fudge was sure it was an isolated incident, and the Muggle Liaison Office 
was dealing with all memory modifications as they spoke.

"Oh, and I almost forgot," Fudge had added. "We're importing three foreign dragons and a sphinx for the






Triwizard Tournament, quite routine, but the Department for the Regulation and Control of 
Magical Creatures tells me that its down in the rule book that we have to notify you if we're 
bringing highly dangerous creatures into the country."

"I--what--dragons?" spluttered the Prime Minister.

"Yes, three," said Fudge. "And a sphinx. Well, good day to you."

The Prime Minister had hoped beyond hope that dragons and sphinxes would be the worst of it, but no. 
Less than two years later, Fudge had erupted out of the fire yet again, this time with the news that there 
had been a mass breakout from Azkaban.

"A mass breakout?" repeated the Prime Minister hoarsely.

"No need to worry, no need to worry!" shouted Fudge, already with one foot in the flames. "We'll 
have them rounded up in no time--just thought you ought to know!"

And before the Prime Minister could shout, "Now, wait just one moment!" Fudge had vanished in a 
shower of green sparks.
